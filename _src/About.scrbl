@title{About this Blog}

This is the blog of me, Matias Eyzaguirre. I'm male, 23, gay, and live in Utah. I'm a maths / computer
science / science fiction nerd and an occasional actor.

I'm still unsure what sort of content will go here, but I imagine the majority of it will be posts
programming and maths.
